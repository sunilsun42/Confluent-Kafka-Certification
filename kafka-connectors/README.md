**what is a worker?**

 A single java process, it can be standalone or disctributed mode.

**Modes to run kafka connect server**

* Standalone mode
* Distributed mode - recommended for production use.

**What is standalone Mode**

* A single process runs your connectors and tasks.
* Configration is bundled with your process
* Very easy to start with, useful for development and testing.
* Not fault tolerant, no scalability, hard to monitor

**What is Distributed mode**

* Multiple workers run your connetors and tasks.
* Configuration is submitted using REST API.
* Easy to scale and fault tolerant(rebalance in case a worker dies)
* useful for production deployment of connectors.

**What is a task and how connector will break them into tasks?**

    Defined the no of tasks that we want to run in parallel.
    For source connector we usually keep it 1(one).
    For sink connectors this property will be set to higher?
